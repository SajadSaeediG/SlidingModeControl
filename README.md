# Sliding Mode Control: classic and optimal

Sliding mode control (SMC) is an effective nonlinear control method used in many applications [1]. This repository is a SIMULINK simulation of SMC with classic [1] and optimized methods as described in [2].

## How to Run
* Open **OptimalSlidingMode.mdl** with SIMULINK
* Choose the simulation method manually, using the manual switch
* Run the simulation
* Run **PlotResults.m** to plot the results for your report

Repeat this process with different methods, by changing the switch, to see the differences.
